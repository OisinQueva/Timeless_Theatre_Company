        <p>
          <b>The HunchBack of Ntre Dame Review:</b>"It is quite the undertaking
          to perform a premiere and to ensure that it lives up to the standards
          expected of a show like this but there is no doubt that Tipperary
          Musical Society exceeded all expectations with this production."

          <b>Cinderella Review:</b>"The young cast engaged enthusiastically and
          spiritedly with the piece, in which director Davide Garattini Raimondi
          produced a suitably light reading, full of comedy; in this reading,
          the sisters have their fun too!"

          <b>The Lion King Review:</b>"The production feels very fluid, with
          characters moving around the full space of the theatre, not restricted
          to just the stage itself. The music is also very impressive, with an
          emphasis on African sounds and beats."

        <p>
          <b>Billy Elliot Review:</b>"Lee Hall's script is given plenty of room
          to breathe and rings with ideas around love and loss, community and
          isolation, passion and violence. The result is a musical of unusual
          depth that distils Hall's play to its essence but also feels nuanced
          and truthful.."
